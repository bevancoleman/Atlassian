# Design Interview
Was on tagging system. Doing API design and then database design. Went with a single table design, probably didn't work out that well... maybe should have though about it a bit more (rushed interview... didn't have time to prep).

Probably going with a 3 or 2 table design would work better. Also make sure that the API structure and DB design match up and work together.

Good reference;
